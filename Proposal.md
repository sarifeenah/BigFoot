# PROPOSAL

*Can Bigfoot sightings be predicted on the fractional amount of moonlight on any given day?*

#### Null Hypothesis:  There is no significant relationship between moon light and Sasquatch sightings

#### Alternative Hypothesis:  There IS a significant relationship between moonlight and Sasquatch sightings

#### OUTCOME

*(the high value ) - (the mean) / std.deviation = zscore In this case is as follows:* 1.0-0.3358059972/.2884055785= zscore 

*if the value of z is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected.*

###### The Z-Test 
1.0-0.3358059972/.2884055785=zscore 
ZScore = 2.302985976 

###### *Very Significant, the alternative hypothesis is accepted!*

## Design Check List

In order to explore this topic I will need to determine: 
1. Measures of Central Tendency
2. Measures of Dispersion
between Bigfoot sightings in the data set and the captured record of moon light in the data set.  

This includes determining the Mean, Mode, Median, Standard Deviation, variance and finally the ZScore.

#### To show the relationships visually I will need:
 a series of scatter plots with trend line analysis
Charts to show changes over time and to compare other variables such as visibility, cloud cover and precipitation. 

I will use sets to filter results.

I  will create calculated fields for % of totalâ€™s overall, sum of sightings, STDEVP reports and a calculation for the Zscore.

I will create Top 5, 3, and 1 sets to visually show the most and least active times places and conditions for BigFoot sightings

I will create two interactive dashboards
To represent my exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the 2nd to tell the story:
How to find Sasquatch by Moonlight

######The EDA dashboard :
will allow exploration of my visualization by filtering on Report Class A, B, C.

###### How to find Bigfoot by Moonlight dashb oard :
For a that little extra something, I will prepare a table that includes verbatim reports as submitted by actual witnesses in the field and include this on my Story dashboard

I will connect the Story telling dashboard to my seasonal sighting chart with my Top and Bottom sets, the verbatim stories and a  ZScore chart of higher than average sightings by state.

This will allow the reader to click on my Sasquatch icon symbols and see the changes in data by season, state and lunar date.
